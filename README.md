# my-cgfs

An Etude for me to get more comfortable with c++ and graphics programming.

---

This project started with me following the book: [Computer Graphics from Scratch](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/). But in the end I was more inspired by 
[tinytracer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer/wiki). Which itself links to some great mathematical resources.

## Results:
